## Concepts Needed

- **Greedy Algorithms**
  - Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
  - Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.

- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
  - The concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.

- **Algorithmic Complexity**
  - Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
  - Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

- **Problem-Solving Strategies**
  - Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
  - Iterative vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

- **Python Programming**
  - Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions.
  - Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
